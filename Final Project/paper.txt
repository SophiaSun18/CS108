I built a secret entrance under the floor...Just in case we need to leave here secretly.
Hope it will not be blocked by the smoke and ash from the fireplace.
If anything happens during night, just get down from your bed and jump into the entrance.
Don't worry about me. I will always do my best to keep in touch with you.
Hope we can meet each other face-to-face soon.

And by the way, make sure this message won't fall into other's hand..
